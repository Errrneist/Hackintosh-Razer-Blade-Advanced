](https://github.com/Errrneist/Hackintosh-Razer-Blade-Advanced/blob/master/DRIVERS/WINDOWS/BLUETOOTH/broadcom_bt_1201940_64_413.exe).
   
### BIOS
* I strongly recommend following the steps from [Razer Blade 15 Advanced (Mojave and Catalina)](https://github.com/stonevil/Razer_Blade_Advanced_early_2019_Hackintosh) to modify your BIOS.
* Note that using other people's BIOS is generally a really, really bad idea. It WILL possibly block your machine. However, I will provide my BIOS as a reference under `./BIOS/afuwin.rom`.

### Audio
* KEXT required to enable Audio support: `AppleALC.kext`
* Make sure you inject audio `layout-id = 3`, not `1` in OpenCore `config.plist/NVRAM/Add/7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82/boot-args` or in Clover, `config.plist/Devices/Audio`. 
 * Please share if you find out other working `layout-id`! 

### Wifi & Bluetooth
* In order to get Bluetooth and Wifi working, a wireless card replacement is needed.
* For now, the best card to use is BCM94360CS2 using a NGFF adapter which you can buy on eBay under $10. It has the highest performance among all other hackintosh-able wireless cards. It is natively supported in OpenCore (v2.X and above). For clover machines, you will want to use DW1830 with some additional kext.

### GPU
##### iGPU
* UHD 630 is supported from 2.X and above. With patched iGPU can achieve internal 240Hz.
* HDMI/mDP Port and USB-C to DP/HDMI/DVI Cables:
   * Long story short, it won't work. Why? Because all display output is hard wired to the NVIDIA GPU. You can confirm this by going into NVIDIA controler panel in Windows and see PhysX, and you can see all display output is wired to the NVIDIA card, while the eDP in screen display is wired to the iGPU. Therefore, since NVIDIA card won't work, also Optimus won't work, the mini-DP and HDMI port or USB-C display output just won't work because the display output is not wired to the iGPU. Not to mention you disabled dGPU in `config.plist/-wegnoegpu`. 
##### dGPU
* NVIDIA RTX 2070 Max-Q is not supported and is disabled with `-wegnoegpu`.
* [Apple and Nvidia Are Over: NVIDIA drops CUDA support for macOS.](https://gizmodo.com/apple-and-nvidia-are-over-1840015246)
* Currently, there is nothing we can do. Let's hope Apple and NVIDIA work together again. 

##### eGPU via USB
* USB DisplayLink Display Output: 
  * Hardware
     * DisplayLink is a USB hardware based solution for display output. 
     * [Plugable USB3-6950-HDMI](https://www.amazon.com/Plugable-Ethernet-Supports-Displays-3840x2160/dp/B075HMWLJF/ref=sr_1_fkmrnull_1?keywords=Plugable+USB3-6950-HDMI&qid=1555380658&s=gateway&sr=8-1-fkmrnull). It is able to achieve 4K60P via the DisplayLink Chip. 
     * Screen I am using: Asus ROG Strix XG279Q (2560x1440, Native 144 Hz). 
  * Software
     * Normally, you should get driver from: [DisplayLink macOS Driver](https://www.displaylink.com/downloads/macos).

### System Preferences
   * [How to customize the ‚ÄúAbout This Mac‚Äù section of a Mac, Joaquim Barbosa](https://www.idownloadblog.com/2017/01/13/how-to-modify-about-this-mac-hackintosh/).
     
### Thunderbolt
##### General
* As of the Clover version (Latest 1.8) thunderbolt seems to be working.
* For OpenCore version (v2.X and above), I have not successfullyimplemented Thunderbolt 3.
* Hardware I tested with: Thunderbolt 3 NVMe SSD enclosure + PM981 1TB.
##### eGPU
* I sold my eGPU so I was not abe to test it, but for OpenCore version, for now, it is probably not going to work.
